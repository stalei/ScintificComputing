These are different errors I encounter while working on HPC. Sometimes it is not easy to understand the main cause of the problem unless with many try and error efforts.
- segmentation fault: mainly happens because the code can't find a pointer. In C filnames are a string and intrinsically a pointer. So if the code can't find a file and you didn't put exception handling in place you will see this error. 
It also could happen if you are out of size for array especially if you have used a dynamic array (malloc).

- DTO completion error: This is hardware related error. The main reson I have seen this error was on memory allocation. If you need more memory but your device doesn't have the memory you need.

- Assertion failed: low memory or no hard disk space.
